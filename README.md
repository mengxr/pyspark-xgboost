# PySpark XGBoost Integration

This is a temporary repo that contains the source code for [PySpark XGBoost integration](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/train-model/xgboost.html#integration-with-spark-mllib-python). 
The goal is to discuss our approach with open source collaborators.
